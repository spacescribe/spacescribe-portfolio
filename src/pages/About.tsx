        <p>
          I’m a passionate developer with a strong interest in cloud computing,
          full-stack development, and modern web technologies. My main focus have been cloud insfrastructure on AWS and Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and AI/ML projects. I love building
          intuitive, responsive web applications and solving real-world problems
          through code. I also work with AI/ML models and data visualization tools.

          reflects my enthusiasm for learning and continuous improvement.
